    In the given area define and assign these variables:
Declare a byte variable named steps and assign 100 as the value
Declare a short variable named miles and assign 5000 as the value
Declare an int variable named count and assign 1000000 as the value
Declare a long variable named population and assign 3434455667 as the value
Every variable must match exactly because the given code will be using those variables
Hint: Remember you can use an underscore in numbers to make them easier to read. They can work like commas in normal use. Also think about what the default type for whole numbers is and how to use long numbers
  Ex:
    the number 1000 can be written as 1_000 to make it more readable, the underscore does not change the value, in both cases they are a value of 1000
    â€‹
    1000000 can be written as 1_000_000
  Ex:
    the number 1000 can be written as 1_000 to make it more readable, the underscore does not change the value, in both cases they are a value of 1000
    1000000 can be written as 1_000_000
